          Last night, 2025 ended.
        </p>

        <p className="line d2">
          And when 2026 started,
          I didn’t feel the need to say something new.
        </p>

        <p className="line d3">
          I just felt the need to say something honest.
        </p>

        <p className="line d4">
          We’ve already spoken about the future.
        </p>

        <p className="line d5">
          About marriage.
          About kids.
          About building a life.
        </p>

        <p className="line d6">
          I don’t talk about those things lightly.
        </p>

        <p className="line d7">
          And I want you to know —
          I remember every word.
        </p>

        <p className="line d8">
          But there’s something small and silly
          I never told you properly…
        </p>

        <p className="line d9 highlight">
          Every time you send that flying kiss 😘
        </p>

        <p className="line d10">
          I become very shy.
          My hands actually start to shiver.
        </p>

        <p className="line d11">
          I laugh,
          my body feels restless,
          like it doesn’t know how to behave around you.
        </p>

        <p className="line d12">
          And honestly…
          if I ever see you in real life,
        </p>

        <p className="line d13">
          I feel like my whole body will shake,
          smile,
          maybe even dance out of excitement 😅
        </p>

        <p className="line d14">
          Because whenever I see you,
          my heart feels your love so strongly.
        </p>

        <p className="line d15 highlight">
          And you are just…
          too cute.
        </p>

        <p className="line d16">
          I’m not rushing anything.
          I’m not asking for more.
        </p>

        <p className="line d17">
          I’m just here —
          steady,
          honest,
          and choosing you.
        </p>

        <p className="line d18 final">
          Welcome 2026 ❤️  
          Same feelings.
          Same intention.
          Still you.
        </p>
